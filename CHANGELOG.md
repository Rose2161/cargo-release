## [0.22.0] - 2022-10-21

### Highlights

The goal of this release is improved workspace support, including
- [Workspace inheritance support](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html#the-package-table)
- Greater control over versioning by supporting calling `cargo release version` as needed and then `cargo release --unpublished`
- Setting configured crate owners when publishing new crates
- Identifying failures early like missing metadata, hitting rate limits, etc
- Inspect changes with `cargo release changes`, including conventional commit support
- Improved defaults

This does mean that `cargo release` (no other args) changed from recovering
from a failed release to releasing the currently specified versions of crates.
Recovery is now done more manually with `cargo release publish`, etc.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `dev-version` support
- `consolidate-commits` is now the default for workspaces
  - It is also now all-or-nothing
- `consolidate-pushes` is now exclusively used
- `dependent-versions = "upgrade"` is now the default
  - Removed `ignore`, `warn`, and `error`
- `Cargo.toml`'s `package.publish = false` disables release
- Removed `--dump-config` in favor of `cargo release config`
- Remove `--token` in favor in favor of more secure ways of authenticating
- `cargo release` is no longer used for recovery, instead use `cargo release publish`, `cargo release tag`, etc
- Error if nothing to release
- Changed standard exit code to 101

### Compatibility

MSRV is now 1.64.0

### Fixes

- Turn some verification errors into warnings on steps
- Run replacements when no version is bumped
- Be smarter about finding previous tags
- Bail out early when we'll hit crates.io rate limits
- Bail out early when we'll hit `cargo publish` missing field errors
- Implicitly layer package over workspace for workspace config when not in a workspace
- Only update versions for path dependencies
- Cleaned up output
- Ignore tests when tracking changes

### Features

- `package.version.workspace = true` support
  - Forces `consolidate-commits = true`
  - Forces `shared-version = "workspace"`
- `dependency.<name>.workspace = true` support
- `package.publish.workspace = true` support
- `owners = []` to set crate owners for new workspace members
  - Use `cargo release owner` to update owners for existing crates
- In addition to `shared-version = true`, we now support named groups, like `shared-version = "foo"`
- `--unpublished` flag to automatically release unpublished crates
- Expose `changes`, `hook`, and `commit` steps

## [0.21.4] - 2022-10-14

## [0.21.3] - 2022-10-13

- Removed `--skip-push` in favor of `--no-push`
- Removed `--skip-tag` in favor of `--no-tag`

Template

Hook
- `${NEXT_VERSION}` and `${PREV_VERSION}` now exclude the build field which is exposed in `${METADATA}` etc

### Features

- Automatically share tags between crates by giving them the same name
  - Recommended to use with `shared-version = true`

### Fixed

- With `shared-version`, bump to highest shared version, rather than error on mismatch
- `cargo-release release` will now skip publishing crates that are already published
- Report tag name conflicts earlier in the process
- `--dump-config` will now also include defaults
- Don't fail on dry-run release in a workspace (from intra-workspace dependency updates)
- `cargo-release <version>` will now work with `-m <build>`
- `cargo-release <version>` will now carry over `-m <build>` from a prior run if none is specified
- Make dirty check more expansive so we don't accidentally commit unexpected filed

## [0.18.8] - 2021-12-31

### Features

- `--dump-config` flag to see defaults and debug config layering

## [0.18.7] - 2021-12-27

### Fixed

- Don't error out when excluding workspace packages that would be downgraded by the current run

## [0.18.6] - 2021-12-08

### Fixed

- Consider optional dependencies when evaluating release order

## [0.18.5] - 2021-11-16

### Features

- Warn users when skipping crates in a workspace that have no changes

### Fixed

- Use static crt on Windows
- Tweak log levels to avoid needing to show all traces to see whats happening

## [0.18.4] - 2021-10-30

### Fixed

- Vendor libgit2 for a more consistent experience

## [0.18.3] - 2021-10-26

### Fixed

- Fix bug where we ignored `push` config

## [0.18.2] - 2021-10-11

### Fixed

- Crash when setting `publish = false` in `Cargo.toml` **and**` in a config file / commandline

## [0.18.1] - 2021-10-09

### Fixed

- Introduced `cargo publish` fix for workspaces that was meant to be in before 0.18

## [0.18.0] - 2021-10-08

### Breaking Changes

`dev-version` is now disabled by default.  This to encourage people to not use
it as it makes it harder for dependent crates to `[patch]` in a version from
git.

### Features

- Opt-in shared crate version.  For now, it just errors on mismatch.  This lets you reference the version in consolidated commits.

### Fixed

- In dev-version commit, render `{{next_version}}`
- Disable always-sleep after publish.  We believe the underlying problem
  preventing us from detecting the crate from being released is fixed.  If you
  run into problems, you can set the env variable `PUBLISH_GRACE_SLEEP`.
- Let packages override consolidated actions
- Switched command-line to more common `no-` prefixes
- Added positive and negative version of each command-line flag to allow overriding the config, and not just defaults.
- Added positive versions of each negative (`disable_`, `no_`) config field
- **Deprecated** all negative (`disable_`, `no_`) config fields

## [0.17.1] - 2021-08-24

### Fixed

- Correctly detect changes for crates outside of the root

## [0.17.0] - 2021-08-23

### Features

- Support `~/.config/cargo-release/release.toml`
- Run `cargo publish` during dry-runs to help catch publish-specific errors
- Add `allow-branch` config setting to limit what branches a release can happen from
- Support `Cargo.toml`s `workspace.metadata`

### Fixed

- In theory, finally fixed it so we properly wait between publishing of crates in a workspace
- Don't warn a user about releasing a crate without changes if a dependency changed
- Notify for all `[[bin]]` crates on `Cargo.lock` change, rather than just the root crate
- Made clearer what are fatal errors during dry-run (since dry-run doesn't stop for them)
- Gracefully handle path-only dependencies which are especially important for cycles.
- Correctly update dependents on post-release version bump.
- Log what was dirty about a repo to make it easier for people to report problems
- Allow pushing even when there isn't a tracking branch
- Specifying `--package` should switch us to opt-in

### Breaking Changes

- `--dry-run` is now the default.   Pass `--execute` to perform the release.
- `exclude-paths` config setting was removed; we now rely on `cargo package --list` to know which files to check for changes.
